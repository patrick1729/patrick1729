## A bit of my history :blossom:

Ever since I was a kid, coding has been my passion. I liked to watch the output of my programs on the computer and was amused to see how we can make them work by writing code. The idea itself would tickle me and also inspired me to create even better programs and enhance my skills. The first utility I programmed was a student management system in C language during high school, which started my journey in coding. I soon then progressed to C++ and Java, and with each language coming along, providing its powers to make even better programs and a lot of learning.

The passion carried me through my college days. Here I would actively participate in coding competitions both online and at the college to test my mettle. I was getting mature in terms of software development as I made the transition from simple Java programs to complex JSP, Servlets and Swing desktop applications. I gradually developed a taste for Android app development and enjoyed creating small apps and again getting surprised by how the apps are developed and understanding the meaning of the word "compatibility".

## Experience so far :hourglass_flowing_sand:
Now, in industry, I hold an experience of 7.5+ years. I have been fortunate to be a part of the following:
- Internship with [Zensar](https://www.zensar.com/) where I've got an opportunity to work on Java, JSP, Servlets and AngularJS
- Banking and Finance Sector (BFS) in [TCS](https://www.tcs.com/) for [Deutsche Bank](https://www.db.com/index?language_id=1) client where I have used and enhanced my knowledge in mobile and hybrid app development
- Fintech product-based startup [Walkover](https://walkover.in/), where I have worked on product [Giddh](https://giddh.com/) to make accounting simple with web and desktop apps, worked on SocketIO integration with NodeJs in real-time chat support app [Msg91 Hello](https://msg91.com/hello/). Setup Microfrontend for the customer support app with [Nrwl Nx](https://nx.dev/)
- Currently working at [Nagarro Software Pvt. Ltd.](https://www.nagarro.com/en) in a medical domain project, built in Angular. Migrated the entire application from Angular v11 to v18.


I enjoy to be a part of skillfully designed performant products that are loved by customers and dealing with architectures of huge applications. I like discussing architectures and their scalability to target a billion users. There's still more to learn and I have just scratched the surface. And for this, I am very grateful.
